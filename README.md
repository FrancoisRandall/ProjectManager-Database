# ProjectManager-Database
A program used to add and store given architecture projects in a MySQL Database

This program will be exactly the same as my ProjectManagement program, which will contain the initial menu options below:

1. Add new Project
2. View non-finalized Projects
3. View Projects past due date
4. Edit or Finalise Project
5. Display all Projects

Each selection will have its own sub-menu.

The difference between this program and the ProjectManagement program, is that this program will make use of retreiving and storing data from a MySQL database instead of a text file.
